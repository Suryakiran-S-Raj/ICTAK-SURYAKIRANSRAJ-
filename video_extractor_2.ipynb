            "[58.36s]  Definitely more so than it has in a while.\n",

            "[63.96s]  So this is an existing Pro Max iPhone 16 and a Pro,\n",
            "[67.36s]  and obviously the non-pro's.\n",
            "[69.00s]  This triple camera thing has basically been the same\n",
            "[71.68s]  for a long time, and this triangular shape\n",
            "[73.88s]  also supporting the spatial video,\n",
            "[75.92s]  which is apparently a big deal to Apple\n",
            "[77.32s]  and one of the reasons why they're gonna maintain\n",
            "[79.08s]  this triangular shape for the upcoming phones,\n",
            "[81.52s]  and they didn't opt for some of the other renders\n",
            "[83.88s]  that people were putting out there with like more streamlined\n",
            "[86.72s]  or horizontal camera layout.\n",
            "[88.92s]  But the difference now is that you're having\n",
            "[91.44s]  this two-tone thing going on.\n",
            "[92.96s]  So this is the first 17 Pro sample,\n",
            "[95.48s]  and actually has some really nice weight to it,\n",
            "[97.08s]  but it's very crude.\n",
            "[97.92s]  Like it doesn't look like an actual phone,\n",
            "[100.36s]  but the reason that these samples exist\n",
            "[103.06s]  is for case manufacturers to get a better idea\n",
            "[105.72s]  of upcoming dimensions so they're ready to sell\n",
            "[108.64s]  when the phone actually hits.\n",
            "[109.72s]  Now a lot of these you've seen online,\n",
            "[111.36s]  you've seen photos of these online,\n",
            "[112.52s]  you probably haven't seen them in hand.\n",
            "[114.08s]  And like I said in this other package here,\n",
            "[115.92s]  we're gonna take things up a notch with a lot more detail\n",
            "[118.24s]  and a much more refined kind of sample.\n",
            "[120.64s]  17 Pro, you can see this one actually has dimensions\n",
            "[122.92s]  listed on it as well, which I think is interesting.\n",

            "[129.28s]  Now the other thing, which appears to be true in this case\n",
            "[132.00s]  using this example is that it's getting a little bit fatter.\n",
            "[134.36s]  And actually that, I mean, that looks true\n",
            "[135.64s]  just holding it there compared to the previous generation Pro.\n",
            "[138.16s]  It definitely looks fatter.\n",
            "[139.12s]  Now does that mean bigger battery?\n",
            "[140.96s]  Yes, most likely, not by a huge margin, but slightly bigger.\n",
            "[144.24s]  The other rumors that are likely to be true here,\n",
            "[146.36s]  faster wireless charging, reverse wireless charging,\n",
            "[148.76s]  so more components in there, faster wired charging,\n",
            "[151.44s]  hopefully jump it up to 35 watts.\n",
            "[153.04s]  Nothing compared to those flagship Android phones,\n",
            "[155.96s]  but no one's gonna complain about faster charging.\n",
            "[158.44s]  Obviously we've still got our camera control button.\n",
            "[160.40s]  The other thing, a lot of these models\n",
            "[161.44s]  seem to highlight this mag safe portion\n",
            "[164.12s]  and also create this outline for this rectangular section\n",
            "[167.32s]  of the back.\n",
            "[168.16s]  And that's because unlike on previous generations,\n",
            "[169.80s]  where the whole thing is essentially this matte glass,\n",
            "[172.80s]  and then you've only got this titanium frame,\n",
            "[175.00s]  supposedly the frame here is actually gonna be aluminum now,\n",
            "[178.00s]  not titanium, it'll make it a little bit more lightweight.\n",
            "[180.52s]  Anyway, and then you'll just have this small portion\n",
            "[182.48s]  of glass in the center, at least that's the prevailing rumor.\n",
            "[185.84s]  Otherwise button layout similar.\n",
            "[187.32s]  You can see they move the flash all the way over\n",
            "[190.00s]  to the other side.\n",
            "[190.84s]  There were some rumors that they were gonna jam a little\n",
            "[192.44s]  screen in here for better selfie video or something.\n",
            "[195.28s]  I don't think that's gonna happen.\n",
            "[196.56s]  That's pipe dream stuff, however.\n",
            "[198.48s]  The other portion to mention with your dynamic island\n",
            "[200.80s]  which still exists there is the front facing cameras\n",
            "[203.04s]  said to see an improvement up to 24 megapixels.\n",
            "[205.76s]  Obviously a new chip, faster device,\n",
            "[207.44s]  slightly bigger battery.\n",
            "[208.44s]  But I don't know how people feel about the design,\n",
            "[209.96s]  which is like the main kind of change.\n",
            "[212.04s]  And the fact that you go to a two tone setup\n",
            "[215.08s]  with a lot less glass.\n",
            "[216.52s]  Okay, let's pull out the caliper real quick.\n",
            "[218.32s]  What does it say on the caliper here?\n",
            "[220.08s]  It says 875, is that what they say?\n",
            "[221.92s]  Yeah, 875.\n",
            "[222.76s]  We are talking about millimeters.\n",
            "[224.04s]  So they're saying that the iPhone 17 Pro 8.75 millimeters\n",
            "[228.16s]  thick, 71.44 millimeters wide,\n",
            "[231.16s]  and 149.63 millimeters tall.\n",
            "[233.92s]  And so that makes it bigger\n",
            "[235.24s]  than the previous generation of Pro.\n",
            "[236.96s]  It just makes it slightly bigger in pretty much every way.\n",
            "[239.32s]  Now maybe the reason for that is because of this rumored\n",
            "[242.04s]  iPhone 17 air.\n",
            "[243.44s]  As I suggested at the beginning of the video,\n",

            "[263.44s]  And normally I wouldn't wear it on my hat,\n",
            "[264.68s]  but I'm actually trying to call it out.\n",
            "[266.04s]  This is like the tiniest little, most convenient clip for you.\n",
            "[269.92s]  If you hope to make content online,\n",
            "[271.68s]  it has this little charge kit.\n",
            "[272.88s]  It can interface directly with your smartphone.\n",
            "[274.68s]  If that's how you record, you can do interviews with a two-pack.\n",
            "[277.36s]  That's included everything stays charged in this little guy.\n",
            "[279.56s]  And it's got a tiny little receiver as well,\n",
            "[282.00s]  which can plug into your camera.\n",
            "[283.40s]  If you use a dedicated camera,\n",
            "[285.04s]  and you don't want to record directly into the smartphone,\n",
            "[287.12s]  it's all in this little kit, which charges up over USB-C.\n",
            "[290.12s]  And then you've also got a travel bag to keep everything secure.\n",
            "[292.88s]  So I've been using their product for a while,\n",
            "[294.76s]  and I wanted to use it in this video just to show you how close you can get it\n",
            "[297.76s]  to an actual studio microphone, even though it's tiny and wearable.\n",
            "[301.48s]  And you can really just clip this mic anywhere.\n",
            "[303.32s]  And of course, it's wireless.\n",
            "[304.36s]  Check out the range.\n",
            "[305.40s]  Like I can just keep moving, but I still sound like I'm sitting right there.\n",
            "[308.56s]  And here's a little Easter egg.\n",
            "[309.84s]  There's actually some video of Apple's CEO Tim Cook\n",
            "[313.36s]  wearing this exact M2S the last time he visited China.\n",
            "[316.52s]  So if you're looking for the perfect little microphone kit to pair\n",
            "[320.32s]  with your eventual iPhone 17,\n",
            "[322.76s]  look at this, check this out.\n",
            "[323.84s]  Boom, this little guy plugs in the bottom.\n",
            "[325.76s]  Now you got a whole production facility\n",
            "[327.64s]  with the phone that's already in your pocket\n",
            "[329.32s]  and an entire microphone kit that also fits in your pocket's perfect.\n",
            "[332.20s]  Let's move on here to the main attraction of this video.\n",
            "[335.64s]  And the reason you clicked on this video inside this package right here,\n",
            "[338.52s]  I believe it's one of one at the moment,\n",
            "[341.24s]  a high quality production and hands on\n",
            "[344.08s]  with the closest sample yet to the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n",
            "[348.92s]  It's amazing the level of detail that they can go into on some of these things.\n",
            "[352.84s]  This one gets its own black bag, velvety bag.\n",
            "[355.92s]  So there it is.\n",
            "[358.96s]  The iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n",
            "[362.20s]  It's kind of weird looking, honestly.\n",
            "[364.44s]  That's a little bit hard for me to believe.\n",
            "[366.24s]  Some seem to suggest maybe it's inspired by the watch.\n",
            "[369.68s]  Like are you feeling that kind of?\n",
            "[371.84s]  Just compare from like which is more beautiful to you.\n",
            "[375.20s]  That's going to take a little while to get used with the two-tone thing.\n",
            "[378.52s]  It's definitely a departure.\n",
            "[380.68s]  People are going to know that you're using the 17 Pro Max\n",
            "[384.08s]  and not the 16, 15 or otherwise.\n",
            "[386.28s]  At least initially I'm not sure that it's as good looking.\n",
            "[388.92s]  Everybody always gets used to these designs,\n",
            "[391.20s]  but initially it's just this big gap\n",
            "[393.32s]  and then having the flash all the way over there,\n",
            "[395.96s]  looking around the device otherwise very similar\n",
            "[398.72s]  wow this even has a functioning.\n",
            "[400.40s]  Look at that.\n",
            "[401.24s]  That's actually the pins in there for the Type-C.\n",
            "[403.36s]  This feels like a finished product honestly.\n",
            "[405.56s]  This is one of the nicest singular manufactured one-offs\n",
            "[410.16s]  that I've ever received.\n",
            "[411.16s]  Look at this thing.\n",
            "[412.00s]  Anyway, everything as far as the layout remains the same, exactly the same.\n",
            "[415.64s]  Even the SIM tray is in the same location, camera control, power.\n",
            "[419.24s]  The camera modules themselves.\n",
            "[421.52s]  Ah, they look roughly the same size.\n",
            "[423.44s]  Display size looks pretty much identical.\n",
            "[425.92s]  It's a huge phone still.\n",
            "[427.20s]  You can see it.\n",
            "[428.04s]  It's visibly thicker.\n",
            "[429.32s]  This new design, at least in the non-camera sections.\n",
            "[432.12s]  If we want to do a quick wobble test.\n",
            "[440.32s]  Okay.\n",
            "[441.60s]  Slightly less wobble.\n",
            "[442.84s]  There it is guys.\n",
            "[443.68s]  The iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n",
            "[446.52s]  Are you guys happy with this?\n",
            "[448.00s]  What do you think?\n",
            "[448.84s]  Like is it going to grow on you?\n",
            "[450.28s]  Is that something you see as an improvement?\n",
            "[453.48s]  To the previous generation, I mean we're talking just about the design.\n",
            "[455.96s]  Obviously they're going to be hardware improvements.\n",
            "[457.84s]  The device is going to have the new chip and be faster.\n",
            "[460.08s]  The cameras are all said to be improved 48 megapixels all the way around.\n",
            "[463.40s]  They maintain their horizontal setup for the purpose of spatial video.\n",
            "[467.64s]  From facing camera, also gets an improvement.\n",
            "[470.12s]  Reverse wireless charging is the rumor, faster charging.\n",
            "[473.12s]  But design-wise, iPhone 16 Pro Max or 17 Pro Max.\n",
            "[478.20s]  What do you think?\n",
            "[479.04s]  I don't know what people are going to think.\n",
            "[479.88s]  I honestly think some people could call it ugly.\n",
            "[481.68s]  I really do.\n",
            "[482.52s]  But it's an iPhone.\n",
            "[483.48s]  You know there's going to be about a billion of these things.\n",
            "[485.40s]  It's going to hit in the market all at once and then people just going to get used to it.\n",
            "[487.80s]  And then a bunch of other companies will copy it.\n",
            "[490.08s]  That's just the future of our lives, whether we like it or not.\n",
            "[492.48s]  Now the trend has been set.\n",
            "[494.20s]  We're going to see funny, two-tone type of smartphones hit in the market.\n",
            "[497.56s]  And it's a market that desperately needs something to feel new anyhow.\n",
            "[502.08s]  It's been a long time like this.\n",
            "[504.08s]  And then they're like, oh well.\n",
            "[505.36s]  It gets slightly bigger, better specs, other improvements.\n",
            "[508.88s]  Now we're titanium.\n",
            "[510.08s]  And then they're like, now or not.\n",
            "[511.44s]  At least again, that's the rumor.\n",
            "[512.48s]  I mean this looks like aluminum.\n",
            "[513.76s]  Anyway, there you have it.\n",
            "[514.76s]  iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n",
            "[516.88s]  The best look yet that you're going to get.\n",
            "[518.76s]  What it's going to be like to have it to hold it, to buy it if you choose to.\n",
            "[522.64s]  Pricing, supposedly going to start around 1250 USD.\n",
            "[526.56s]  They're going to be pricey beasts and they're going to be out relatively shortly.\n",
            "[530.16s]  And as I mentioned at the beginning of this video, I may have some other very nice models\n",
            "[534.84s]  coming in shortly.\n",
            "[535.84s]  So make sure to subscribe if you want to see those comparatively.\n",
            "[539.04s]  And also if you're in the market for any kind of microphone improvement in your audio production,\n",
            "[543.60s]  whether you're shooting on a smartphone or a camera, you got to check out our partners\n",
            "[546.76s]  at Haulie Land.\n",
            "[547.76s]  They're making some really cool stuff.\n",
            "[549.48s]  And this little device is my favorite.\n",
            "[551.64s]  Oh yeah, and another thing.\n",
            "[552.72s]  Maybe you don't love the two-tone design and you're going to put a case on it.\n",
            "[556.80s]  You could always go with a later case.\n",
            "[558.40s]  Look at that.\n",
            "[559.40s]  One-tone, super thin.\n",
            "[560.40s]  So your newer, fatter iPhone doesn't have to feel any fatter than that.\n",
            "[564.60s]  So yeah, if you haven't yet, check out later case.\n",
            "[567.12s]  Super crazy thin phone cases for your existing iPhone or your new iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n",
